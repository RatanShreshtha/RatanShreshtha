# PHD Comics
[PHD Comics](https://phdcomics.com/comics/most_popular.php) has been around a long time, for Interweb standards anyway. It's a collection of hundreds (thousands?) of comics about university life... and probably a fair amount of other stuff too.

# The Oatmeal
[The Oatmeal](https://theoatmeal.com/) is hit or miss for me personally, but the degradation of social skills of a remote worker is pretty darned funny.
