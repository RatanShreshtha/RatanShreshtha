# Hi, I am Ratan Kulshreshtha

I work as a software development engineer at Telstra India.

I write a blog called ["RatanShreshtha"](https://ratanshreshtha.dev/posts/) which contains my thoughts and findings related to programming, technology, gadgets, photography, comics, tv-series and other things.

I was born in [Agra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra), India and graduated from the [National Institute Of Technology, Durgapur](https://nitdgp.ac.in/) (NIT Dgp) with a B.Tech in Information Technology. Besides programming I enjoy photography, cycling, comics, binge-watching and music.
