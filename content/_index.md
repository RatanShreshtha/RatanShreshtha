# Hi, I am Ratan Kulshreshtha

You are very welcome to my corner of internet. I like to describe myself as a writer.

> I write code and poems

I have a blog called ["RatanShreshtha"](@/posts/_index.md) which contains my poems, thoughts and other findings.

I was born in [Agra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra), India and graduated from the [National Institute Of Technology, Durgapur](https://nitdgp.ac.in/) (NIT Dgp) with a B.Tech in Information Technology. Besides programming I enjoy photography, cooking, cycling, comics, binge-watching and music.
